    "\n",
    "I predict that finding the ZPL will take the longest time since it requires precise alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortest to complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that finding different fringe patterns should not take too long, for a similar reason in that we are playing with alignments rather than trying to find a precise one"
